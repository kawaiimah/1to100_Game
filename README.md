## 1to100_Game
My baby steps in Python where I learnt various aspects of coding to create a simple number guessing game.

# v1
- Using variables
- Using random library's randint function
- Using print function to output information to the display

# v2
- Using a 'main' function
- Using sys library's exit function
- Using input function to get user input
- Using if function to make decisions

# v3
- Updating our main function to ask for player for a number
- Then print bigger or smaller
- At this point the game only asks once, then will reveal the secret

# v4
- let's add in an option for player to enter 'q' to quit
- Also, let's add in some error checking on player's input

# v5
- Now let's allow the player to re-enter a guess after an invalid input

# v6 (final!)
- Finally, let's allow the player to keep guessing until correct
- Included a counter to keep count of how many tries!
